            <h2>What is Kendama?</h2>
            <p>Kendama is a traditional Japanese skill toy/game. Recently it has been introduced to more people around the world.
                The community behind the game is getting bigger and bigger by the years!</p>
                <p>The principle of these toys are the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string. However the modern kendama style takes influences from a diverse range of skills including yo-yo, diabolo, juggling, and poi.</p>
