            <h2>What is Kendama?</h2>
            <p>Kendama is a traditional Japanese skill toy/game. Recently it has been introduced to more people around the world.
                The community behind the game is getting bigger and bigger by the years!</p>
            <p>The principle of these toys are the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string. However the modern kendama style takes influences from a diverse range of skills including yo-yo, diabolo, juggling, and poi.</p>

            <h2>How to play?</h2>
            <p>Always hold the Ken like youâ€™re writing with a pencil. This will allow you to land it on any three of the cups.</p>
            <p>Pull the ball up, instead of swinging the ball. This will give you more control when you attempt to land it on the cups.</p>
            <p>Watch the ball all the way to the cup. It helps to cushion it as if you were catching an egg.</p>
            <p>Be patient. It takes years to master the Kendama, just stay calm and breatheBe patient. It takes years to master the Kendama, just stay calm and breathe</p>
